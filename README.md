## Installation  
- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Lyall/DragonTweak/releases). 
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the the game folder.  

### Steam Deck/Linux Additional Instructions
🚩**You do not need to do this if you are using Windows!**  
- Open the game properties in Steam and add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%` to the launch options.  

## Configuration
- Open **`DragonTweak.ini`** to adjust settings.

## Troubleshooting
- If the ASI loader name **`dinput8.dll`** is incompatible with your configuration, please refer to this [list of possible DLL proxies](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader#description).
- **Yakuza 6 & Kiwami 2** use a different folder structure so remember to make sure that **`DragonTweak.asi`**, **`DragonTweak.ini`** and **`dinput8.dll`** are in the same folder as **`Yakuza6.exe`** or **`YakuzaKiwami2.exe`**.
